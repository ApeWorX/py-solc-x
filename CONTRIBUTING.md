## Cute Animal Pictures

All pull requests need to have a cute animal picture. This is a very important
part of the development process.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcomed! Please try to adhere to the following.

- code should conform to PEP8 and as well as the linting done by flake8
- include any relevant documentation updates

It's a good idea to make pull requests early on. A pull request represents the
start of a discussion, and doesn't necessarily need to be the final, finished
submission.

GitHub's documentation for working on pull requests is [available here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
